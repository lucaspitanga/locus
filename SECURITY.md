## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report any vulnerability by contacting me directly.

Some vulnerabilities within the website can be present since it's meant to be displayed more as a design. You can contact me either trough my email or any of my social links, if your report gets declined is because the fixing of the vulnerability could cause a complete change of structure which would originate more vulnerabilities, if it's accepted the fix shouldn't take long to be uploaded.
